# Uncute Rina

TransPlace's somewhat random bot with a lot of interesting and funky additions for the server

I've recently (2023-01-18) decided to update the readme to actually tell you how to use this program lol.

## Installation

- Copy the GitHub (basically: download all the files)
- Install python3.11.1 (or newer, maybe) (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Also run the following commands to install the modules of the most recent discord.py version (v2.0) and pymongo for the online database

You will need a mongo database to use this bot. For more info, look at https://mongodb.com/

[//]: # (- pip install -U git+https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/)
[//]: # (i likely won't be using the latest version anymore: only the stables)
- `pip install discord pymongo motor pandas apscheduler matplotlib requests`

## Usage

Add a token.txt file in the same folder as the program, and put the discord token in it (raw, no quotes or anything, just the token).

Add a mongo.txt file in the same folder, and copy-paste the MongoDB connection string from your database to this file.

Direct yourself to the right directory/folder (in a terminal; or so I'd like to run it: cd C:\Users\USER\x\) and run the main file using `py Uncute-Rina.py`

## Support

DM MysticMia in the server

## Roadmap

There are no real future plans for now. Whatever I want to add usually gets added within the first week after thinking about it or getting it suggested to me.

## Contributing

It is not possible to contribute with writing the code. You can give suggestions for ideas or code by contacting me though.
